// They are more flexible compared to other programming
// language list data types.

// In python/ Java they have List, Dict, Set, Tuple
// which are under the array family.But these list 
// data types all have a special job or function, where as 
// in JS it universal.

// Js Array is a data type for collecting and storing
// other data

var name = 'Jamal'
var grocery = ['apple', 'milk', 'water']
// An array can store
var generalList = [name, grocery, 132323, 23.34, true];

// Array Methods
// A method a function that works on a list (or object).
// methods are written after the list variable name and 
// declared with period
//pretty much; the method is going inside of the list
// and running instructions on data from the list
console.log()
console.error()

// push method()
generalList.push('New data')
console.log(generaList)

// Pop method() -This method removes a piece of data
// from alist. It will remove the last item in that list.
generalList.pop()
console.log(generalList)
  //length() method - this method counts the number of data 
  // inside of a list
  console.log(generalList. length)
